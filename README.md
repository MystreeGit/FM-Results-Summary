# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

This one took me quite the bit of time to complete. While the project might be very unorginized and poorly coded, I was still able to learn a lot while making it; Things such as css variables, data-attributes, a furthered understanding of grid, flexbox, and how they work together, some html semantics, utility classes, and a bunch of other tiny little things that I can't even remember off the top of my head. One part of the challenge asked to use javascript to import some custom numbers but honestly I don't feel up to that right now. My main goal is to build up my understanding of html and css and once I feel somewhat confident in these two I'll add on javascript.
